- check how the bundler makes pango.modules, could this help our pangpfxft2 issues?

	bin/gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders > lib/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/2.10.0/loaders.cache

See:

Steps:

0) reset download, build and install area

	If you had a previous gtk-osx build system you are updating, flush the
	whole of the old build area, but keep downloaded tarballs, if possible

		mv ~/gtk/source/pkgs .
		rm -rf ~/gtk/inst
		rm -rf ~/gtk/source/*
		mv pkgs ~/gtk/source

	Stale files here will cause a range of annoying problems.

	If you are using homebrew or macports or fink, make sure those systems
	are turned off. For example, "sudo mv /usr/local /usr/x"

	Remove the optional Apple X11 libs as well, eg. 
	"sudo mv /opt/X11 /opt/x", we don't want any configure files picking 
	them up either.

	Check your environment too.

1) install gtk-osx

	Remove any old .jhbuild* files first. 
	Remove ~/.local
	Remove ~/Source

	See:

		https://live.gnome.org/GTK+/OSX/Building

	Download and run the latest gtk-osx-build-setup.sh to update your
	build system.

1a) append

	setup_release()

   to your ~/.jhbuildrc-custom to enable optimisation

2) jhbuild bootstrap 

   	this has to be first, since it builds .xz support for extracting 
	archives

2a) jhbuild build python

	some of the later modules, for example gobject-introspection, assume 
	you are using the jhbuild python, you need this

	it installs to ~/gtk/inst and that area is added to the jhbuild shell
	for you, so no need to touch your .profile

3) jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap

4) jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-core

	you might have a patch fail in gtk+, if you do, check line 159 of
	gtk-osx.modules:
	
	<patch file="/Users/john/Development/GTK-OSX/gtk-osx-build/patches/gtk+-2-m4-creation.patch" strip="1"/>

	I guess this should be:

	<patch file="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk-osx/plain/patches/gtk+-2-m4-creation.patch" strip="1"/>

4a) this is a good time to take a snapshot

   	cp -r ~/gtk ~/gtk-snapshot

   now you won't need to rebuild the universe for a new vips change, or perhaps
   a new imagemagick version test

5) append 

	moduleset = "file:///Users/john/GIT/build-osx/7.40/vips-osx.modules"

   adjusted appropriately to ~/.jhbuildrc-custom

6) jhbuild build nip2

	You may have problems downloading openslide on some versions of OS X.
	If you see this error:

		curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is
		OK. Details:
		error:14090086:SSL
		routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed

	you need to update your cert bundle.

	Download a new bundle from here:

		http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html

	point your curl at it like this:

		export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/Users/john/Desktop/cacert.pem 

	and rerun the jhbuild.

7) jhbuild run nip2 

	To test the build.

8) install the bundler:

	https://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/OSX/Bundling

8a) build resample.plg

	jhbuild shell
	cd ~/package/vips/transform-7.30
	make clean
	make
	cp ~/package/vips/transform-7.30/resample.plg ~/gtk/inst/lib
	^D

9) ./package-nip2.sh

	you may get the error

		Cannot find source to copy: /Users/john/gtk/inst/lib/charset.alias

	I used an old one in ~/john/gtk/inst/lib

	will generate ~/Desktop/nip2-x.x.x.app.dmg, using the binary in 
	~/gtk/inst

10) open ~/Desktop/nip2-x.x.x.app

	to test the packaged app.

	Try renaming ~/gtk to something else to make sure you're not
	accidentally picking up files users may not have. "mv ~/gtk ~/x".

	Test application text (menus etc.), rendering in nip2 windows (drag a
	region, verify that labels are drawn correctly) and pango ft2 text
	(load the businesscard.ws example).

	Verify that in-app icons work, eg. the nip2 icon in the background of
	the "About" dialog. 

	Verify that goffice plots work: Hist / New etc.
