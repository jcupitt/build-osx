See:

Steps:

0) reset download, build and install area

	If you had a previous gtk-osx build system you are updating, flush the
	whole of the old download and build area:

		rm -rf ~/gtk

	Stale files here will cause a range of annoying problems.

1) install gtk-osx

	See:

		https://live.gnome.org/GTK+/OSX/Building

	Download and run the latest gtk-osx-build-setup.sh to update your
	build system.

2) jhbuild bootstrap --ignore-system

	Older versions of OS X have very old system components which cause
	breakage later. --ignore-system means always build our own.

3) jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap

4) jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-core

5) append 

	moduleset = "file:///Users/john/GIT/build-osx/7.30/vips-osx.modules"

   adjusted appropriately to ~/.jhbuildrc-custom

6) jhbuild build nip2

	You may have problems downloading openslide on some versions of OS X.
	If you see this error:

		curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is
		OK. Details:
		error:14090086:SSL
		routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed

	you need to update your cert bundle.

	Download a new bundle from here:

		http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html

	point your curl at it like this:

		export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/Users/john/Desktop/cacert.pem 

	and rerun the jhbuild.

7) jhbuild run nip2 to test the build

8) install the bundler:

	   https://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/OSX/Bundling

9) ./package-nip2.sh

	will generate ~/Desktop/nip2-x.x.x.dmg, using the binary in ~/gtk/inst

9) open ~/Desktop/nip2-x.x.x.app

	to test the package
