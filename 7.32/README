See:

	http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=Build_on_OS_X

Steps:

0) reset download, build and install area

	If you had a previous gtk-osx build system you are updating, flush the
	whole of the old build area, but keep downloaded tarballs, if possible

		mv ~/gtk/source/pkgs .
		rm -rf ~/gtk/inst
		rm -rf ~/gtk/source/*
		mv pkgs ~/gtk/source

	Stale files here will cause a range of annoying problems.

	If you are using homebrew or macports or fink, make sure those systems
	are turned off. For example, "sudo mv /usr/local /usr/x"

	Remove the optional Apple X11 libs as well, eg. 
	"sudo mv /opt/X11 /opt/x", we don't want any configure files picking 
	them up either.

	Check your environment too.

1) install gtk-osx

	See:

		https://live.gnome.org/GTK+/OSX/Building

	Download and run the latest gtk-osx-build-setup.sh to update your
	build system.

2) jhbuild bootstrap --ignore-system

	Older versions of OS X have very old system components which cause
	breakage later. --ignore-system means always build our own.

3) jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-bootstrap

4) jhbuild build meta-gtk-osx-core

4a) this is a good time to take a snapshot

   	cp -r ~/gtk ~/gtk-snapshot

  now you won't need to rebuild the universe for a new vips change, or perhaps
  a new imagemagick version test

5) append 

	moduleset = "file:///Users/john/GIT/build-osx/7.32/vips-osx.modules"

   adjusted appropriately to ~/.jhbuildrc-custom

6) jhbuild build nip2

	You may have problems downloading openslide on some versions of OS X.
	If you see this error:

		curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is
		OK. Details:
		error:14090086:SSL
		routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed

	you need to update your cert bundle.

	Download a new bundle from here:

		http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html

	point your curl at it like this:

		export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/Users/john/Desktop/cacert.pem 

	and rerun the jhbuild.

7) jhbuild run nip2 

	To test the build.

8) install the bundler:

	https://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/OSX/Bundling

8a) build resample.plg

	jhbuild shell
	cd ~/package/vips/transform-7.30
	make clean
	make

9) ./package-nip2.sh

	will generate ~/Desktop/nip2-x.x.x.app.dmg, using the binary in 
	~/gtk/inst

10) open ~/Desktop/nip2-x.x.x.app

	to test the packaged app.

	Try renaming ~/gtk to something else to make sure you're not
	accidentally picking up files users may not have. "mv ~/gtk ~/x".

	Test application text (menus etc.), rendering in nip2 windows (drag a
	region, verify that labels are drawn correctly) and pango ft2 text
	(load the businesscard.ws example).

	Verify that in-app icons work, eg. the nip2 icon in the background of
	the "About" dialog. 

	Verify that goffice plots work: Hist / New etc.
